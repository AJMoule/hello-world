# hello-world
Just a test repository

Andrew Moule and this is a test. I have recently graduated from Northeast Wisconsin Technical College (NWTC). I am currently looking for a Softare Developer position.
This will be my first attempt at helping the Open Source Community and I hope that I can contribute quality code.
